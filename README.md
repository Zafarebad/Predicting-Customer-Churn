# Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to discontinue services, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) based on demographic, usage, and account-related features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Demographic details  
- Services subscribed  
- Account and billing information  
- Customer status (Churn or Not)  %

## Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)  
- Deep Learning (TensorFlow / Keras)  

## Methodology
1. **Data preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing churn patterns and feature correlations.  
3. **Model training** – Training multiple machine learning and deep learning models.  
4. **Hyperparameter tuning** – Optimization using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.  
5. **Model evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
6. **Comparison** – Selecting the best-performing model and extracting business insights.  

## Results
- Example: *Random Forest* and *Deep Learning models* achieved high accuracy and recall, making them effective in identifying churners.  
- Visualizations highlight key churn drivers such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data processing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning implementation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development and analysis
